The force field, topologies and coordinate files for the 650-ns equilibrated LPS membrane are freely available for download. The atomic coordinates in PDB format can be visualized in with most molecular graphics programs such as VMD, PyMol, and alike. The force field and topology files are compatible with the GROMACS suite of programs. These files are expected to be error-free, but please do check them for errors. If you find any issue please drop us an email. If you make use of the topologies and/or atomic coordinates for you research, please cite Kirschner, Lins, Maass, Soares. 2012. Journal Chem. Theory Comp. (2012). DOI: 10.1021/ct300534j.
